# Heart-attack-risk-prediction using random forest algorithm
## Description:
-This project aims to predict the risk of heart attacks by analyzing retinal images using Fuzzy C-Means Clustering. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, we can derive meaningful insights from retinal data, potentially aiding in early detection and preventative measures for cardiovascular diseases.
