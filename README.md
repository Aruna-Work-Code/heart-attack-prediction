# Heart-attack-risk-prediction using random forest algorithm
## Description:
    This project aims to predict the risk of heart attacks by analyzing retinal images using Fuzzy C-Means Clustering. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, we can derive meaningful insights from retinal data, potentially aiding in early detection and preventative measures for cardiovascular diseases.
		
## Features:

### Retinal Image Analysis: 
Utilizes high-resolution retinal images to identify patterns associated with heart attack risk.
### Fuzzy C-Means Clustering:
Implements Fuzzy C-Means clustering to classify image features, enhancing the accuracy of risk predictions.
### Risk Prediction Model: 
Develops a predictive model based on clustered data to estimate the likelihood of heart attack occurrences.
### User-Friendly Interface: 
Provides a simple interface for uploading images and viewing risk assessments.

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- OpenCV
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Fuzzy Logic
